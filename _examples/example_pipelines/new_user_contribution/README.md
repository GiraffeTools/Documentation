# What to include in your contribution
We'd love to include your pipeline in our example gallery! To do so,
follow our guidelines as described on the [website](timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine/examples).

Make sure to include to add the following files to your directory (which
should be located at `docs/_examples/example_pipelines/your_dir_with_example`):

1. Your `.pork` file
2. Your `.py` file (Nipype script generated by Porcupine)
3. (optional) your Dockerfile (generated by Porcupine)

Then, make sure to include a new markdown-file with the description of your
pipeline. A template is provided (`docs/examples/template_example.md`), so
it's easiest to just copy that file and adjust accordingly!
