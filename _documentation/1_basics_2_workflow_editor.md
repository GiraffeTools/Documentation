The workflow editor is the part of GiraffeTools you'll probably spend most of your
time building your pipeline. In this window, you'll initialize the nodes of
your pipeline and draw connections between them. In the basics section of this documentation, we'll explain how to build Nipype-based pipelines in GiraffeTools such as the simple skull stripping pipeline below.

### Nodes in GiraffeTools
When you open GiraffeTools, you'll start with an empty workflow editor. To begin
building your pipeline, you'll have to initialize some nodes. A "node" represents
a specific operation within your pipeline, ranging from neuroscience-specific
operations like skullstripping or motion-correction to more generic operations
like file I/O.

Currently, GiraffeTools provides nodes based on interfaces from
[Nipype](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python-based software
package providing wrappers for all major neuroimaging software packages.


### Initializing nodes with the node menu
To start building pipelines, you'll of course need some nodes!
To initialize nodes, navigate through the [node menu](/GiraffeTools/documentation/basics/node-menu) 
on the left of GiraffeTools's GUI, which shows you all the Nipype-interfaces
that GiraffeTools supports. Selecting, for example, `fsl` and, in turn, `preprocess`
shows you all the available nodes from FSL's preprocessing suite (including the skull 
stripping node from the image above, `fsl.BET`). 

Simply drag your node of choice into the workflow editor and reposition as you please!

## Input-ports and output-ports
Now, suppose you've created a skull stripping node (`fsl.BET`) and a node to save the results
(`io_DataSink`) node. Looking at, for example, the `fsl.BET` node, 
you see the name of the interface (here "fsl.BET") at the top of the node. 

Below the name of the interface, the node's "ports" (as we call them) are listed.
Each port is either an input-port, recognizable by the little blue dot on the
*left* side of the node, or an output-port, recognizable by the little red dot
on the *right* side of the node. In the screenshot of the FSL BET node below,
for example, the `in_file` parameter represents an input-port, while the
`out_file`, `mask_file`, `outline_file`, etc., represent the node's output-ports.
(For Nipype-nodes, these input-ports correspond to the `inputs` attribute/traits
of nodes, and the output-ports correspond to the `outputs` attribute/traits.)

Importantly, by default, the node *only* shows the **mandatory** input-ports,
while it shows by default all output-ports. In the
[next section on the parameter editor](/GiraffeTools/documentation/basics/parameter-editor),
you'll learn how to customise nodes by changing the name (e.g. fsl.BET to Skullstripping), 
accessing the node's non-mandatory input-ports and how to control which output ports are 
shown and which are not (for example, to reduce the visual clutter in pipelines with nodes 
which have a lot of output-ports.).

## Connecting nodes
Given that you've initialized a couple of nodes, it's trivially easy to connect
them. Just click on an output-port and drag your cursor towards another node's
input-port, which draws a line between the two ports. To save the results of our 
skull stripping, we could for example connect the `out_file` output-port
from the BET-node (representing the skullstripped structural file) with the
`Bet_results` input-port from io_DataSink-node (representing the file(s) to be saved).

Now, there's more to building pipelines than initializing and connecting nodes.
In the [next section on the parameter editor](/GiraffeTools/documentation/basics/parameter-editor),
you'll learn how to control the functionality and visualization of your ports
in more detail.
