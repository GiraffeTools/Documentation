Perhaps GiraffeTools' coolest feature, is that it automatically generates the code
necessary to actually run your pipeline. This bring us to GiraffeTools'
"code editor", located below the workflow editor. As you define your
pipeline using the workflow and node editor, notice how GiraffeTools creates your code!

### Generating Nipype-based Python scripts
GiraffeTools creates a Python script under the Nipype-tab in the code editor. 
In this script, all the necessary imports, initialization of nodes, connection 
between nodes, and the actual call to execute the pipeline (or "workflow", in Nipype-terms) 
are properly defined. In other words, you can just save the script as a Python-file 
(e.g. `my_pipeline.py`) and run it in your terminal (i.e. `python my_pipeline.py`)!

Of course, you can edit the script to your own liking before saving if you want!
For example, we set the [workflow-plugins](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/plugins.html)
by default to `Multiproc` with a single core (which will run the pipeline serially),
but you could edit this directly in the code editor to use a different plugin or
more cores!

### Generating Dockerfiles
In addition to generating the code necessary for running your pipeline,
GiraffeTools also generates a "Dockerfile". A Dockerfile is a file that specifies
how the software package [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) should
build a virtual ("containerized") operating system in which all the dependencies
to run your pipeline are installed. In other words, a Dockerfile is like a recipe,
specifing all "ingredients" (dependencies) needed to run your pipeline.

For example, suppose you've build a skullstripping pipeline for T1-weighted images,
in which you use ANTs for bias correction, AFNI for skullstripping, and
FSL to threshold the brain-mask (like our [example pipeline](/Documentation/examples/skullstrip-example) based on a pipeline from the [niworkflows](https://github.com/poldracklab/niworkflows) package).
Accordingly, GiraffeTools will then add the software packages ANTs, AFNI, and FSL (the "ingredients")
to the Dockerfile, such that other people can evaluate your pipeline in a
fully replicable environment specified in your Dockerfile! 

For more information on GiraffeTools' Dockerfile generator, check out the
section on [building dockerfiles]() in our documentation.

By now, we've discussed the three major "editors" in GiraffeTools necessary to
build your pipeline: the workflow editor, the node editor, and the code editor.
The next section of the documentation is about the "parameter editor", a somewhat
less "important" window in GiraffeTools, but which can help you organize the hard-coded
variables in your pipeline.
