Porcupine is software that allows you to create analysis pipelines visually
using a drag-and-drop interface, which Porcupine then converts to code for you!
In order to effectively use Porcupine, you have to understand the different
windows (which we call "editors") in Porcupine. In the figure below (click to enlarge),
you see an example pipeline and its representation in Porcupine, which is
split up in four "editors":

1. the **workflow** editor
2. the **node** editor
3. the **code** editor
4. the **parameter** editor.

In the "Basics" section of the documentation, we'll work you through the basics
of Porcupine by explaining each editor and how it relates to the process of
building a fully functioning and reproducibly pipeline in Porcupine!
